# Plant_Leaf_Disease_Detection
Agriculture plays a vital role in India. The lifecycle of the crop, being a continuous process, gradually faces the presence of plant diseases that potentially have substantial consequences for crop yield. Recognition of these illnesses at the leaf level is essential for crop management that operates well. Identifying the diseases of plants in a prompt manner and as quickly as possible is the key to minimizing the extent of the diseases.


Traditionally, plant disease classification used to be written down on paper and inspected in person. It was done by observation and by visual. Such a way could also be tedious, and the problems of errors could only be constrained but incomplete. According to the above reasoning, there is a high demand for an intelligent system of automatic image classification, that is based on the characteristics of plant leaf diseases. This system would become a revolutionary tool for crop management, as it would allow the detection of diseases faster and more accurately. Additionally, it would improve the successful yielding of crops and ensure global food security.

In this paper, we consider the latter problem, resorting to applied data science and in-depth learning approaches. For the convolution part, Python and one convolutional neural network (CNN) named AlexNet will be the tools we are going to use. The following article will give you a glimpse into the internal architecture of AlexNet, which you will find useful in constructing your deep learning model as well as developing a readily applicable classification model for plant disease detection.

The objective of this project is to address the following problem statement "Categorize the ailment in a plant leaf by only observing its appearance displayed in the photo."


Hence, we can comprehend the disease of the crop along with the name, as seen in the case of their plant leaf sample having certain signs.
Therefore, a deep-learning model that accurately recognizes and classifies plant leaf images have been created with the aim of solving this issue. In relation to this report, we will use AlexNet, an eight-layered CNN, which is a widely adopted neural network for image-classifying techniques. To provide authenticity comparisons, the deep learning algorithms that are known to be very accurate such as ResNet, MobileNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, and CNN were also tested.
